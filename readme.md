# FONTFIX

Fixes fonts for some websites that do not display correctly on chrome. The font-family is either not rendered or is replaced by some other font which makes it hard to read the webpage. 

Changes the font to monospace for the current webpage and persists the change. So, if you change it once for a website, everytime you open it, the monospace font will apply after the page loads. 

Some websites where I faced this issue was: https://packagist.org/ & https://filestage.io/

- Clone the repo
- Enable developer mode in chrome
- Load unpacked extension
- Locate and done!
